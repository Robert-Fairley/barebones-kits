# Barebones Kits

A series of starter kits for web projects.

### About the Kits

Bare-minimum, lightly-opinionated foundations for web applications. Just clone, install dependencies, and build out from there.

Each kit includes a testing framework and a basic unit test written for the main App component, whatever
form it takes. Mocha is used as the base testing framework, with additional features sometimes included. Jsdom
is used for simulating the DOM.
